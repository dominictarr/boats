# construction, winter '06.

It was coming into winter. I saw studing my honours year of Computer Science 
at University of Waikato, in Hamilton, New Zealand. 
After bicycling from wellington back to hamilton in the summer (about 560 km, 
I think) I had decided that, for sanity, I would only do all my school work on 
the week days -- only going in in the weekend "If I wanted too". 

This also gave me plenty of time to build a boat (also when I wanted to). I did
take probably 6 months to finish the boat, but I didn't work on it consistantly.

I started designing it on my computer, estimating the bouyancy id need (the 
previous boat did not have the necessary amount of boyancy - it did not sit high
enough in the water. I would sail along with my ankles wet. 
It was good enough for the smooth water of the lake, but at sea it just did not
feel sailorly.

I had my heart set on a tortured ply hull. I'd seen gary's boats up close last 
summer and I was impressed, but wanted to do it my own way. I would not recomend
this if you just wanted a boat. It is harder, and will take longer, but you'll 
learn more. You'll learn to design. Actually, I'm more interested in design than
sailing, and sailing is a great view into design. I knew that and that is why I 
was doing it the hard way. I wanted to understand everthing. 

Unfortunately I did not understand very much about tortured ply construction. 
I still don't. There isn't very much information about it on the internet, and
every one who writes about it says trial and error is the only way. I tried, 
errored, and then tried something else. After a few models which seemed to work
I decided I would buy some plywood. I didn't want to do this, but the plywood
I typicially found scavanging wasn't flexible enough.

I brought 3 sheets of interor grade 4mm radiata pine plywood for $75 NZ. This
is going completely against the advice of most boat builders on the internet.
Radiata is knotty and soft and held in low regard in New Zealand, although it
is what is used to frame houses. 4mm interor radiata was available in every 
hardware store in '06 (havn't seen it recently), is nearly as flexible as gaboon
(which is the recomended boat building plywood), and I figured that if it was 
sealed in epoxy it would be good enough. If it lasted the summer I'd be happy.

I'd seen a kayak design that did a clever thing by making the hull from one sheet 
with joins in the ends only. The mid-section was just a "U" shape with no lateral 
join. This is both the optiomal hull shape and I figured would save me dollars in
glue. 

I tried doing something similar but I couldn't get it to work. I could bend the 
sides up, but could not get the ends together without twisting the whole boat. 
Eventually I gave up, and cut two more notches in the ends, making the ends of 
the boat chined, and the center U shaped. Unfortunately this forced the ends
down a bit, and the hull ended up with a small amount of negative rocker. The hull
actually got deeper in the front and back than it was in the middle. In theory 
this should make the boat harder to turn. After struggling with the hull for 
sometime, I was just happy to get it all together. 

I built the ama the same way, but had a laterial join, to get it narrow enough.
(the bend of the main hull was at the limit of flexibility of the wood). 

I had no plan or list of things I needed to make the boat. whenever I got stuck
at something I would stop, but then I would see the piece of wood I needed or
something sitting in a rubbish bin somewhere. I saw the perfect wood for my
rudder and leeboards on my birthday, and after my family took me out for dinner
I made them stop so I could grab the wood and bring it home in thier car.

I had selected some bamboo from a local park. bamboo is a weed in new zealand, 
so I just went and cut it, tied it to by bicycle and wheeled it home. I scraped
the outer coating off, drilled an air hole in each segment to prevent cracking,
and left it in the garage to dry out. I still had the sail from my first boat.

The rudder was very simple. I rounded so it seemed more hydro-dynamic, and bolted 
it to a small square board - with just one bolt so it could pivot up if it hit 
something. The small board was then attached to the stern with gate hinges from
the hardware store. I don't think there was any specialized marine hardware on 
the boat at all.

I had the lauching ceremony down the road in a pond at the university. All my 
friends arrived to watch, and some even went in the boat. I named the boat 
"Not Even Ow!" this won't make much sense if you don't speak New Zealand. 
it's meaning is kinda a lot like "No Way Josse", which is also a good name
for a boat, but also has a pun on the asymetry of the design.

one time, when the boat was about half finished, I read a kayak magazine in a 
fish-and-chip shop. Some one had written an article about a kayak trip they did
down the waikato river, then portaging 10km to into the manakau harbour. this 
avoided the dangerious bar of the waikato river, and the exposed and rough west 
coat. then they kayaked the harbour and then portaged through Auckland City, 
which is built on as ismuth. (I've heard that the maori name for Auckland 
translates to "Ismuth of a Thousand Lovers"). This was all a traditional 
trade route that had beed used by both the maori and europeans, before the 
railway was built. 

Now I knew how I was gonna get my boat to the sea. It was also the perfect shake 
down cruise. I could warm up slowly, starting in the shelter of the river, then 
step up to crossing manakau harbour, and then after crossing through auckland, sail
to waiheke island, and so on, in the hauraki gulf. It's important when your doing
something potentially dangerious like this, to try things one step at a time,
give it a chance to fail, and if it doesn't, then you can take it further.

For portaging I needed a trolley. A suitable trolley refused to just appear, 
so I had to build one from bicycle parts. It ended up an ridiculus micky mouse 
contraption: two 12 inch wheels, in 26 in forks, lashed to 4x2s, with the boat 
dismantled and tied on top. It didn't work very well. But it was enough to 
move the boat around.

So I had the boat ready. I moved out of my flat, (spent the last two weeks before 
departure in a friends spare room while I did the finishing touches, and finished
up my part time job) I packed everything in, and wheeled it down to the river.

a friend saw me off, and I paddeled off into the unknown. 

My adventure began at 12:40 PM on December the 3rd 2006.
